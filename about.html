    <H4>Hello I'm Scout, a golden retriever.</H4>

      <p>I was born on June 15, 2015 in Marlborough, MA at Birdwing Golden Retrievers. Carolyn, who runs Birdwing, delivered and named us "Jettie's Island litter". Jettie is my birth Mum and Skipper, my birth Pup. As one of four girls and three boys, I was named Ellis after the island that served as a gateway for millions of immigrants to the United States between 1892 and 1954. [Coincidently, my great-great grandmother, Gabrielle, traveled from Belgium to the United States through Ellis Island on October 27, 1919 when she was 11 years old.]  
      </p>

      <p>Jettie gave birth to us in this order:
      <ol> <li>Catalina</li>
            <li>Sanibel (now known as Capri)</li>
            <li>Castle</li>
            <li>Maui</li>
            <li>Flint</li>
            <li>Ellis (now known as Scout)</li>
            <li>Marco</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>When I was a very little pup, Carolyn declared me "unflappable" which some think is a perfect behavioral trait for living in New York City. I now live there with my people. My other personality attributes include being very sociable, playful, curious, and strong. In addition, I'm very cuddly, willing to please, loyal, and quiet. I was named after Miss Jean Louise Finch, the much beloved protagonist in "To Kill a Mockingbird."</p>

      <p>I am a city and country dog. When we're in New York City, we miss the country and when we're in New Hampshire, we miss the city. After three months, I have adjusted pretty well to both locations and I am a good traveler.</p>
