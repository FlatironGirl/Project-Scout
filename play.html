        <h3>Watching the street life</h3>
        <p>I spend a lot of time looking out the windows of our apartment looking for birds on rooftops and watching taxis, fire engines, and people walking below. I'm always on the look out for dogs.</p>

        <img src="Images/IMG_4809.JPG" alt="Bathtub">
        <h3>Digging in the bathtub</h3>
        <p>I jump into the bathtub every day and wait for the water to drip out of the faucet or shower head. I am partial to digging holes in there, too. It's very peaceful.</p>

      <section class="col-1 outline">
        <img src="Images/IMG_4910.JPG" alt="Watching TV">
        <h3>Getting screen time</h3>
        <p>My screen time is limited but sometimes I watch Morning Joe. Commercials with ringing doorbells send me flying to the door and the ones that feature barking dogs send me into an energetic frenzy.</p>

        <h3>Chewing on luvvies</h3>
        <p>I still have this mad desire to chew stuff. I'll happily go to work on the corners of a nearby rug but that gets me into trouble. My people divert my attention to something more appropriate.</p>

        <h3>Taking Walks</h3>
        <p>Rain or shine, we take lots of long walks in our neighborhood. I usually see Oliver, Parker, Chewy or Zoe from our building so we play and get tangled up in our leashes.</p>

        <img src="Images/IMG_4300.JPG" alt="Kitchen Stove">
        <h3>Looking in the Mirror</h3>
        <p>I can look at myself in the mirror for quite a long time. The stove door works well, too. The same goes for all those mirrored windows out on the street.  I stop, look away and look back quickly.</p>

        <img src="Images/IMG_3865.JPG" alt="Adirondack on the Dock">
        <h3>Hanging on the dock</h3>
        <p>New Hampshire is where I kick back on the dock, swim, run around, explore, and dig holes in the yard. I also love to play tether ball. I can leave my soccer ball in the yard and it's still there the next day!</p>
